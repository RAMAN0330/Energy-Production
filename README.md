## Introduction

This project focuses on enhancing energy management by developing predictive models for monthly energy production. Time series analysis techniques are employed to analyze and interpret sequential data points collected over time.

## Time Series Analysis

Time series analysis is a statistical technique used to analyze sequential data points typically ordered by time. The primary objectives include identifying the underlying nature of observed phenomena and predicting future values of the time series variable.

## Applications

Time series forecasting has various applications, including:
- Energy production and consumption forecasting
- Weather forecasting
- Earthquake prediction
- Astronomy
- Statistics
- Mathematical finance
- Econometrics
- Pattern recognition
- Signal processing
- Control engineering

## Stages in Time Series Forecasting

### Visualizing Time Series

The initial step involves visually exploring the data to identify underlying patterns such as trends and seasonality.

### Stationarizing Time Series

A stationary time series exhibits consistent statistical properties over time. Transforming a series into a stationary form is often necessary for accurate forecasting.

### Determining Model Parameters

Using tools like Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF), optimal parameters for forecasting models are determined.

### Fitting the Model

The chosen model is applied to learn and capture the underlying patterns of the time series data.

### Making Predictions

The fitted model is used to predict future values of the time series based on established patterns.

## Installation

To install the necessary packages, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
To use the scripts for time series analysis and prediction:

- Load the dataset.
- Preprocess the data by defining column names, dropping nulls, and converting the date column to DateTime format.
- Visualize the time series.
- Stationarize the time series.
- Determine model parameters.
- Fit the model.
- Make predictions.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of time series analysis for forecasting monthly energy production. By identifying patterns and developing predictive models, it aims to enhance energy management and decision-making processes.
